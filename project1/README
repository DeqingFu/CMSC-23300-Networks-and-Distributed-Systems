-- Source Codes
  * The source codes contains 
    ** Makefile:            "make" to generate the binary file
                            "make clean" to clean up 

    ** README:              This file

    ** utils.c & utils.h    files that implements some utility functions 
                            including: 
                              - read and write on server
                              - print error messages
                              - check validity of port (numeric and bounded)
                              - convert hostname to ip for comparison and 
                              validity checking

    ** client.c & client.h  files that implement the client functionalitie
                            for both TCP and UDP, specified by the "flag" 
                            vairable: flag == 1 -> UDP
                                      flag == 0 -> TCP
    
    ** server.c & server.h  files that implement the server functionalities
                            for both TCP and UDO, specified by the "flag", 
                            same as in client.c

    ** snc.c                the main function that parses inputs from stdin, 
                            dealing with options and executing programs given 
                            input options and information


-- Compile
  execute in the command line: $ make


-- Usage & execute
  $ ./snc [-l] [-u] [hostname] port
    ** -l:                  specifies as the server, 
                            if not included in options, it's the client

    ** -u:                  specifies as UDP, 
                            if not included in options, it uses TCP protocols
    
    ** [hostname]:          optional if -l is specified, required otherwise
    
    ** port:                port number, should be integer between [1025, 65535]


-- Example / Functionalities
  * Open two terminals, execute the following each 
      Terminal_1 $ ./snc -l 8080
      Terminal_2 $ ./snc localhost 8080

  * Type in Terminal_2 (the client) 
    and Terminal_1  (the server) will print out what you typed in Terminal_2

  * If you type ctrl + D in Terminal_2
    **  if you specified to use UDP (-u), then the connection is lost, 
        but you can still type things in Terminal_2 (the client), 
        but the server won't print out anything
    
    **  if you use UDP (without -u option), 
        then both the client and the server will be terminated

  * Other usages and explanations:
    **  UDP, the program will execute using UDP 
        Terminal_1 $ ./snc -l -u 8080
        Terminal_2 $ ./snc -u localhost 8080
    
    **  Specify hostname from the server 
        /* per TA, the server only listen to the client w/ given hostname */
        Terminal_1 $ ./snc -l -u 127.0.0.1 8080
        Terminal_2 $ ./snc -u 127.0.0.1 8080
